- I added an appropriate Logger, make clear all info and errors.
- I used MVVM as default design pattern
- I devided Constants, Extension, Enumeration, protocols as much as possible.
- I devided groups with related files.
- I added comment as much as possible, rather I prefered well designed function and property names.
- I try to avoid retain cycle, and cared variables reference count.
- I try to avoid massive ViewController. So, I devided function with related extensions.

- Finally, I added three demo to demonstrate my work. ->
